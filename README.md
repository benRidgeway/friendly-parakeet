# Password Generator
##I had to commit this in one go because i messed up my repo and was on a time crunch to make up the work i missed. 
##I did a lot of research and found out how to make the password generator work within the page, instead of just using alerts, I hope thats ok.
##This project is a password generator that takes into consideration different parameters that the user sets and then creates a randomized password accordingly.
